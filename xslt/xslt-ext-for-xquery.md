//
// xml transformation language extension for xquery .
// with this ext, xslt can become obsolete.

// where to start : 
  - base units for transformation
  - ops to combine the base units into components for transform
  - name it xtl = xml transformation language = xtrans 
  - treat xtl like xpath, standalone spec, but dependent on xquery as parent.
